              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Trading cryptocurrencies, stocks, futures, and other financial instruments carries a high level of risk
                and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as
                for you. Before deciding to trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of
                experience, and risk appetite.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                There is a possibility that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment.
                Therefore, you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the
                risks associated with trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any
                doubts.
